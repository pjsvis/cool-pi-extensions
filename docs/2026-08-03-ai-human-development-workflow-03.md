Here is the development story: how we moved from corporate friction to the vibe-coding delusion, and finally to our minimal, deterministic control plane—guided by incremental steps and epistemic guardrails.

## The Development Story

### Act I: The Old Way (The Illusion of Control)

We began in the era of corporate theater. Software was treated as a static product to be delivered through rigid stage-gates. We built massive, off-site documentation sanctuaries—SharePoint, Confluence, 50-page Word documents, and waterfall proposals disguised as agile backlogs.

The primary effect was severing the feedback loop. By hiding the documentation far away from the execution boundary, teams swept technical debt under the rug to meet arbitrary deadlines. The schema rotted into a twisted replica of its original design, but as long as the PDF was signed off, management claimed success. We mistook administrative artifact production for system progress.

### Act II: The New Way (The Vibe-Coding Delusion)

Then came the AI wave, promising a magical shortcut: *Vibe Coding*. The dream was irresistible—say a single sentence into a prompt box, sweep the implementation details into an unconstrained model, and watch software materialise.

To make this work, the industry built over-engineered "edge-lord" stacks: heavy vector databases, complex custom graph wrappers, and opaque MCP servers that indexed descriptions of code rather than the code itself. But the unconstrained AI didn't build software—it built a *picture* of software. It gave us what it figured would make us go away happy, while underneath, unmeasured entropy, broken invariants, and subtle hallucinations accumulated. We had simply traded corporate Word documents for high-cost probabilistic fluff.

### Act III: Our Way (The Sovereign Agentic Workspace)

We stripped away the corporate theater and the vibe-coding hype, returning to a fundamental truth: **software was always a process, and the product is just a side effect.**

Instead of hiding complexity in an opaque box, we co-located the intent with the execution. We turned the repository into an autonomous, self-documenting state machine:

1. **Co-located Plain Text (`README.md`):** Serves as a continuous **Shannon Checksum**. If the code changes and the local README doesn't, the checksum fails at the commit boundary.
2. **Zero-Effort OKF (ISO Dates):** Prefixing files (`2026-08-04-brief.md`) across `briefs/`, `debriefs/`, `decisions/`, and `playbooks/` gives human and agent instant $O(1)$ chronological topology without extra database overhead. The active view stays small; older files migrate to `.archive/`.
3. **Operational Vocabulary (`Justfile`):** Hardened, standard endpoints (`just brief`, `just debrief`) abstract build and verification steps into a shared protocol.
4. **In-Flight Memory (`marcus/td`):** Atomic task tracking and locks ensure context persists across session resets and prevents multi-agent collisions.

Repo memory remains the absolute ground truth; the agent’s internal memory is merely a volatile cache. Briefs start as aspirational hypotheses, debriefs record the collision with reality, and decisions solidify into hardened playbooks.

## The Next Step Is Always Smaller Than We Think

When faced with building an AI-assisted workflow, the natural temptation is to imagine we need a massive, complex architecture—graph databases, custom search engines, complex orchestration servers.

In reality, **what works is what is already in front of us.**

What do we *actually* need to run this system today?

* A standard Git repository.
* Plain-text Markdown files with `YYYY-MM-DD` prefixes.
* A `Justfile` to standardise commands.
* A lightweight, terminal-native task tracker (`td`).
* A local or low-cost model running inside a disciplined harness.

You don't need to build an enterprise platform to start. You add a `README.md` to a folder. You add a `Justfile` target. You write a brief. Each step is minimal, concrete, and immediately verifiable.

## The Epistemic Guardrails

To keep the workspace grounded and prevent us from falling back into corporate bloat or AI hype, we run every proposed tool, process, or feature through two relentless operational questions:

### 1. The James Watt Question: *What is the thermodynamic efficiency of this mechanism?*

* **The Test:** Does this tool actually reduce the energy (tokens, friction, cognitive load, time) required to achieve work, or is it an over-engineered engine that burns friction just to turn its own gears?
* **The Application:** A custom MCP server indexing 89 files with a proprietary Python search engine fails the James Watt test—it burns massive operational energy for zero efficiency gain over `grep`. A `YYYY-MM-DD` filename passes instantly—it delivers $O(1)$ chronological context at zero token cost.

### 2. The Daniel Derrida Question: *What is the explicit contract, and where is the difference between the signifier and the reality?*

* **The Test:** Where is the disparity between what we *claim* the system is doing and what it is *actually* executing? Is there an unexamined gap between the text and the execution?
* **The Application:** Vibe coding and off-site Word docs fail this test—they create a wide gap between declared intent and actual code. Co-located READMEs and the two-job Brief/Debrief loop pass this test—they force an immediate reconciliation step (the Shannon Checksum) that surfaces disparities at commit time.

## Verdict

By anchoring our work in the **James Watt Question** (demanding practical efficiency) and the **Daniel Derrida Question** (demanding structural truth and exposing deltas), we ensure our workspace remains lean, explicit, and low-entropy.

**Artifact is proof.** If it isn't persisted in plain text in the repo, it doesn't exist. If it isn't immediately available for inspection, it is friction.
